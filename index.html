            <h2 class = "spaghetti header">Spaghetti</h2>
            <p class = "spaghetti explanation">Spaghetti's history traces back to Arab traders introducing dried pasta ("itriyya") to Sicily in the 8th century, though ancient noodle-like foods existed. Sicily became a pasta hub, exporting long pasta strands by the 12th century, with the name "spaghetti" (little cords) appearing in 1874. While initially eaten with butter/cheese, the iconic pairing with tomatoes emerged in the 19th century after tomatoes became widely accepted, and mass production and global fame followed in the 19th and 20th centuries.

        <div class = "steak">
            <h2 class = "steak header">Steak</h2>
            <p class = "steak explanation">The history of steak traces back to ancient grilling, but the term and modern concept emerged in 15th-century Europe, with Scandinavian "steik" (roast) and Italian "bistecca" (beefsteak) popularizing thick cuts from hindquarters, especially in Florence with its Bistecca Fiorentina; it became a staple in America during the 19th-century cattle boom, leading to the rise of steakhouses and celebrated as a cultural icon for celebrations, from ancient bonfires to modern dining.
